# Blender QRCode Creater (Beta)
![QRCode Mesh](../media/tkk.png?raw=true)
---

### I am new to Blender and Addon Development!
### This code is going to require a lot of work and refactoring!

This Blender Addon will allow you to create a QRCode with some unique features:

1)  Create QRCode with traditional block look.
2)  Create QRCode with circle blocks.
3)  Add an adjustable solidifier.
4)  Deform the Z-Axis of the QRCode mesh as a Pyramid or Swirl.

**ADDON DEPENDENCIES**

This addon requires the Python qrcode module be installed within your Blender environment.
Use pip to install qrcode.

**import pip**

**pip.main(['install', 'qrcide', '--user'])**

**Installation**

To Install, simply download the zip and use the Blender Addon installation process.  Once installed the Addon UI will be available from the Right side of the 3DView pullout.

**This is an example of how you might use a QRCode with Pyramid Deformation and Solidify to put hair on a simple character where the QRCode only "comes into view" from the top of head view".**
